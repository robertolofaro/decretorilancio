You can read the narrative at https://robertolofaro.com/swarmlaw

Concept:
1. on 2020-05-19 the Italian Government released a 263-pages, 266-articles Government Decree for the post-COVID19 restart of the Italian economy.
2. on 2020-05-20/21 released a webapp https://robertolofaro.com/decreto (search by tag cloud)
3. on 2020-05-20 and 23 released a Kaggle frequency dataset https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/decreto-rilancio-dl-20200519-word-frequencies
4. on 2020-06-03 updated the webapp to add the linkup to the actual text of each article stored here, to allow for line-by-line reference

Purpose: an experiment in dissemination to ease access and evidence-based negotiation using open data and open platforms, without necessarily being involved in the ensuing uses

Next steps: further experiments and probably updated on the webapp and Kaggle dataset based upon request

Disclosure: beside my Italian passport, I have neither political nor organizational affiliation with any State, local authorities, or private sector organization in this endeavour
